#  I am Bautista Sánchez 🥳

> I'm a twenty-years-old full stack developer 👨🏽‍💻. I got into the programming world almost five years ago and I have been learning and applying that new knowledge ever since. See my [16personalities profile here!](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/3ede20010c15e)

##  Who am I? 🤔
I am a web developer and tech enthusiast, who loves to think out of the box, and find my way through logical problems. I also love graphic design, and applying that interest to web development.

I have exposed myself to a wide variety of languages such as `Java, Python, SQL and JavaScript`. This way, I can read almost any code I see and truly _understand what is happening_.

I’m interested in web development, software engineering, gaming, photography and financial markets. I love cinema, sci-fi, cyberpunk and fantasy being my favourite genres. I also like to read fantasy, classical and philosophy books in my free time.

There is a ever-growing diversity of projects in my GitHub profile that show some of my skills and interests.
