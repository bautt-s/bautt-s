> I'm a twenty-years-old full stack developer 👨🏽‍💻. I got into the programming world almost five years ago and I have been learning and applying that new knowledge ever since. See my [16personalities profile here!](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/3ede20010c15e)

##  Who am I? 🤔
I am a web developer and tech enthusiast, who loves to think out of the box, and find my way through logical problems. I also love graphic design, and applying that interest to web development.

I have exposed myself to a wide variety of languages such as `Java, Python, SQL and JavaScript`. This way, I can read almost any code I see and truly _understand what is happening_.

I’m interested in web development, software engineering, gaming, photography and financial markets. I love cinema, sci-fi, cyberpunk and fantasy being my favourite genres. I also like to read fantasy, classical and philosophy books in my free time.

There is a ever-growing diversity of projects in my GitHub profile that show some of my skills and interests.

##  Soft skills 😄

I would describe myself as a very extroverted person, never afraid of speaking up when something goes wrong, and with high communicative skills, willing to step up to any challenge that may arise.

I am really great at explaining complex matters in the simplest way so even people who might not be remotely close to my area of expertise are able to understand what I am talking about (e.g., parents, friends, coaches). You could say I adapt quickly to my environment.
